;;; Commentary:

;; This module adds RandR support for EXWM.  Currently it requires external
;; tools such as xrandr(1) to properly configure RandR first.  This
;; dependency may be removed in the future, but more work is needed before
;; that.

;; To use this module, load, enable it and configure
;; `exwm-randr-workspace-output-plist' and `exwm-randr-screen-change-hook'
;; as follows:
;;
;;   (require 'exwm-randr)
;;   (setq exwm-randr-workspace-output-plist '(0 "VGA1"))
;;   (add-hook 'exwm-randr-screen-change-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (start-process-shell-command
;;                "xrandr" nil "xrandr --output VGA1 --left-of LVDS1 --auto")))
;;   (exwm-randr-enable)
;;
;; With above lines, workspace 0 should be assigned to the output named "VGA1",
;; staying at the left of other workspaces on the output "LVDS1".  Please refer
;; to xrandr(1) for the configuration of RandR.
