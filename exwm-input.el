;;; Commentary:

;; This module deals with key/mouse matters, including:
;; + Input focus,
;; + Key/Button event handling,
;; + Key events filtering and simulation.

;; Todo:
;; + Pointer simulation mode (e.g. 'C-c 1'/'C-c 2' for single/double click,
;;   move with arrow keys).
;; + Simulation keys to mimic Emacs key bindings for text edit (redo, select,
;;   cancel, clear, etc).  Some of them are not present on common keyboard
;;   (keycode = 0).  May need to use XKB extension.
